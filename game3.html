      A vertical survival runner game originally made for the 18th Tilted Game Jam with the themes: "Elf and Presents"
      <br>
      <br>
      This 12 hour game jam was one of the last game jams I did before covid with a group of experience friends. Given I have programmed and known my teammates prior, this game jam went smoothly without hiccups. The team composition ended up being one artist and four programmer. In the end, I was given the task of producer which control the workflow and troubleshoots any issues while given the more remedial programming jobs of player control, camera control, and asset placement.
