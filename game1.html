      A short bullet hell game originally made for the 16th Tilted Game Jam with the themes: "Waifu-lious, Bomb, Walmart, Scooter"
      <br>
      <br>
      This game project was my first entry into game development in the midst of this 12 hour game jam! This event was a great ordeal trying to learn and develop in the Unity Engine(C#) in the hectic 12 hour with only coding experience in Python, Java, and C++.
