        A episodic minigame game originally made for the Global Game Jam 2020 with the theme: Repair
        <br>
        <br>
        This game jam was the most prepared I was with the experience of the previous one: Tilted game jam 17  and 18. I had made a team with 3 other people that new each other: an artist, a programmer, and a sound designer. The goal was to make a game in a 48 hour span competing on a global scale. Given the experience, I was in charge of the majority of the level design, object instantiation and AI pattern.

        <br>
